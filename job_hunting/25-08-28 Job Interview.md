Hello Neale, it’s a pleasure to be here. I’m a **Software Engineer** with over four years of experience, specializing in **backend and full-stack development** with **Python** and **TypeScript**.

I currently work as a **Mid-Level TypeScript Developer** at **PagWay**, where I contribute to our **backend, backoffice, and front-end systems**. My work includes designing and maintaining **NestJS services**, implementing database operations with **Prisma**, and integrating with **payment gateways and messaging systems** using the **3DS protocol** and **twillio**.

Previously, at the State Attorney’s Office, I led a large-scale migration to a **microservices architecture** built with **NestJS**, and developed REST and GraphQL APIs in **Python (Django)**.

I have solid experience with **PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka, and RabbitMQ**, and I’m proficient with **Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines** for deployment automation. On the cloud side, I work extensively with **AWS services**—including **EC2, ECS, Lambda, S3, Route 53, RDS, and CloudWatch** and I’m a strong advocate of **Clean Architecture.

I’m very excited about this opportunity, and I believe my background in building **scalable, maintainable Python and TypeScript backends**, combined with my expertise in **APIs, data consistency, DevOps, and AWS cloud environments**, aligns perfectly with the challenges of the coming role.
